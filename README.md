## Description

_{Plan and create an application to track animals at your local Zoo. With this APP I need to allow zoo workers at the zoo to add and edit animals to the application. The app will include photos of the animals, name, age, diet, location, caretakers, sex, likes and dislikes. The user will be able to edit add and/or delete the animals information. For now, images are not set up to display on the cards of the animals but in the future that will be the main goal.}_
